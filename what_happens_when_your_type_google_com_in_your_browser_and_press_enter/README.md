# What Happens When You Type `https://www.google.com` in Your Browser and Press Enter?

This repository contains an in-depth article that explains the journey of a simple URL request, such as `https://www.google.com`, through the various layers of the web stack. This question is a common interview topic for software engineering positions and serves as a great way to demonstrate your understanding of how the internet and web technologies work.

## Overview

The article covers the following key components of the process:

1. **DNS Request**  
    Explains how the browser resolves the domain name (`www.google.com`) into an IP address using the Domain Name System (DNS).

2. **TCP/IP**
